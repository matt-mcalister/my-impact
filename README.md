# imPACT

## What is this?

imPACT is an application to help you make activism in the 2018 midterm elections a part of your routine. You get to set the terms of your pact--from 10 hours to infinity (show up your friends and make a 400,000 hour pact!)-- and then log any activity that you do (ie  canvasing, phone banking, etc.) in order to track your progress. Additionally, read about spotlighted candidates, causes and events to help you find opportunities to fulfill your hours.

## Usage Tips

First Tip: The 2018 elections are over, but feel free to check out the functionality regardless.

From the landing page, you'll be greeted with a short video and explanation of what the app is all about. You'll then have the choice to login, sign up, or download the companion mobile app. If you're not interested in the mobile app, fear not! this website is mobile friendly.

#### Sign Up

As you are signing up, in addition to filling out useful information like your name, username, email and password, you'll be prompted first to either upload a profile photo or select one of the stock icons. Then, you'll be asked to set a goal- a number of hours that you would like to complete before the midterm elections.

#### Dashboard

Once you have successfully signed up or logged in, you'll be taken to your dashboard. On the dashboard you'll see a progress bar up top, with a list of your logs below. If you click on the grey plus symbol above the logs, you'll be able to add a new log.

Additionally, once you've logged in the navbar will change, giving you the options to see events and spotlights on the left side, or click the three dots on the right side and you'll now have the option to change your account settings or sign out.

#### Adding A Log

When the new log modal appears, simply use the plus and minus buttons to indicate how many hours you would like to log, and enter any information in the optional fields that are relevant (ie Event, Organization, Donation amount, and Date, which defaults to the current date if not specified).

When your new log has been entered, the modal will disappear and you'll see your list of logs and progress bar have been updated.

#### Events

The events page will show the events you are attending near the top, with all events in a container below. You are also able to filter the events by state. If the event is in the past, it will be greyed out with a label that indicates "This Event Has Passed".

When you click on an event, you will see helpful information like the title, date, location, description, the organizer, and who is attending. There will also be a button the allows you to either attend the event, or leave the event if you are already attending.

#### Spotlights

The spotlights page displays a feed of spotlighted organizations, candidates and causes that the imPACT team has chosen to highlight.

#### Account Settings

On the account settings page, you are able to change your photo (again, either by upload or select one of the preset icons). You are also able to change your pact. 

When selecting your pact, you will see how many hours per week would need to be completed between that moment and the 2018 midterms, how many hours per week would need to be completed between that moment and the end of 2018, and how many hours per month would need to be completed between that moment the 2020 Presidential Elections.
